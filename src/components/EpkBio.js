								"VA-based artist Nsay Mada channels vintage R&B on fantastic new single “Cumulus”, where mellow keys and a soulful vocal presence
								remind aesthetically of Paul Weller’s ’80s project The Style Council, though more chilled-out. Off her recently released, debut EP Out
								Her Space, the track is a vibe-y and melodically cool success elevated by wise production flourishes, ranging from the clever melodic
								transition around 03:20 (reminiscent of Little Dragon) to the backing effect-laden vocal bits at 01:27. “Cumulus” is a consuming,
								electric effort throughout from a quickly ascending artist."
